    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Command design pattern helps us encapsulate an operation (undo, redo, copy, paste, and so forth) as an object. What this simply means is that we create a class that contains all the logic and the methods required to implement the operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of doing this are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) We don't have to execute a command directly. It can be executed on will.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) The object that invokes the command is decoupled from the object that knows how to perform it. The invoker does not need to know any implementation details about the command.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) If it makes sense, multiple commands can be grouped to allow the invoker to execute them in order. This is useful, for instance, when implementing a multilevel undo command."
