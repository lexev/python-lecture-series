    "\n",
    "The Abstract Factory design pattern is a generalization of Factory Method. Basically, an Abstract Factory is a (logical) group of Factory Methods, where each Factory Method is responsible for generating a different kind of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know when to use the Factory Method versus using an Abstract Factory? The answer is that we usually start with the Factory Method which is simpler. If we find out that our application requires many Factory Methods which it makes sense to combine for creating a family of objects, we end up with an Abstract Factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of the Abstract Factory that is usually not very visible from a user's point of view when using the Factory Method is that it gives us the ability to modify the behavior of our application dynamically (in runtime) by changing the active Factory Method. The classic example is giving the ability to change the look and feel of an application (for example, Apple-like, Windows-like, and so on) for the user while the application is in use, without the need to terminate it and start it again.\n",
